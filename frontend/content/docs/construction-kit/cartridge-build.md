# Cartridge Build Guide

## What the app generates

When a student clicks **Generate C**, the app converts Blocks JSON to game IR and then deterministic C.
With **Assembly (RISC-V)** or **C + Assembly** chosen in the **Generated code**
list, the same game IR also becomes explained RISC-V (RV32IM) assembly, and
**Compile Cartridge** can build the cartridge from `game.S` instead of
`game.c`. See `generated_code.md`.

Generated C exports three functions:

```c
void my_game_init(void);
void my_game_update(void);
void my_game_draw(void);
```

The function prefix comes from the project title, sanitized as a C identifier.

## Advanced C projects

Choose **Advanced C** in the project editor to write against the full portable
PRG32 cartridge ABI. `prg32.h` also declares resident-only services; the
cartridge toolchain reports an undefined symbol if one is used. Use
[PRG32's ABI specification](https://github.com/riscv-prg32/PRG32/blob/main/prg32/abi/prg32_abi.json)
to identify the portable functions. **Copy generated Blocks C** provides a
starting point. Save the C source before compiling. The source remains in the
project JSON export, and the bundle includes the exact saved file as
`source/game.c`. Define `<title_prefix>_init`, `<title_prefix>_update`, and
`<title_prefix>_draw` with `void` arguments; for a project titled "My Game",
the prefix is `my_game`. Only PRG32 and small freestanding standard headers
are accepted. Before building, the kit also rejects tricks that would let C
read files on the server while it compiles: directives hidden behind comments,
`%:` digraphs and `??=` trigraphs, inline assembly (`asm`, `__asm__`),
`_Pragma`, `__has_include`, and the `##` token-pasting operator. The PRG32
compiler checks the actual API calls and types.
List any firmware features the cartridge needs in **Required PRG32 features**.
The kit passes those names to PRG32's `--required-feature` option so an
incompatible runtime rejects the cartridge before execution. For Blocks
projects the kit works the features out from the blocks (sound blocks need
`audio`, tile blocks `tilemap`, and so on); projects that use multiplayer also
get the builder's `--multiplayer` option, which marks the cartridge header.
See `prg32_feature_coverage.md`.

The browser simulator runs Blocks projects. Test Advanced C cartridges in
PRG32 QEMU or on the physical ESP32-C6 board. The editor does not compile C
proposed by an AI assistant or silently change saved source.

## Compile and download a cartridge

When a student clicks **Compile Cartridge**, the app:

1. saves the Blockly JSON;
2. regenerates C;
3. creates a build record;
4. writes `game.c`, `project.blocks.json`, and `game.ir.json` to `data/builds/<build_id>/`;
5. runs the configured PRG32 build command for `esp32c6` and `qemu` labels,
   with a private temporary folder `data/builds/<build_id>/tmp/` (removed
   afterwards) and a time limit of `PRG32_BUILD_TIMEOUT` seconds;
6. creates directly downloadable `.prg32` artifacts and a Cartridge Store bundle zip.

After a successful build, green download buttons appear above the editor. The
portable cartridge can be uploaded to a device slot through the PRG32 setup
page or the upstream `python3 -m prg32 esp32c6 upload` command.

## Download a .prg32 cartridge in one click

Students who only want the finished cartridge do not need to download the C
source. Click **Download .prg32** in the editor toolbar: the app saves the
project, generates C, compiles a cartridge for the PRG32 board (ESP32-C6), and
the browser downloads the `.prg32` file straight away. Use the small arrow next
to the button to choose **QEMU emulator** instead.

The generated C is still saved as an artifact and shown in the **Generated C**
tab, so it can always be inspected. If the PRG32 toolchain is not installed on
the server, no file is downloaded and the **Debug Log** explains why.

## PRG32 build command

Default (with the same Python that runs the kit):

```bash
<kit python> -m prg32 cartridge build
```

Installing the tools and the compiler, for Docker, macOS, Linux and Windows,
is explained step by step in `install_cartridge_build.md`.

The app appends:

```text
game.c --portable --architecture <esp32c6|qemu> --cart-ram-kib 64 --entry-prefix <prefix> --name <slug> --out <slug>-<architecture>.prg32
       [--required-feature <feature> ...] [--multiplayer]
```

The PRG32 tooling can be installed into the kit's Python environment from a
PRG32 checkout (`.venv/bin/pip install --no-deps -e ../PRG32`), or run from
that checkout with `PYTHONPATH`. The RISC-V compiler `riscv32-esp-elf-gcc` from ESP-IDF 5.4 must
be on `PATH`.

Override the command:

```bash
export PRG32_BUILD_COMMAND="python3 -m prg32 cartridge build"
```

PRG32's current default firmware profile provides 64 KiB of executable
cartridge RAM. The kit passes this limit explicitly so the builder catches an
oversized game before upload. Set `PRG32_CART_RAM_KIB` to the target firmware
profile's value when it differs from 64.

Only `PRG32_MAX_PARALLEL_BUILDS` builds compile at the same time; the others
wait for a free build slot. See `concurrent_builds.md`.

## Run a cartridge on QEMU or PRG32-QT

```bash
python3 -m prg32 qemu upload my-game-qemu.prg32
python3 -m prg32 qemu run
```

PRG32-QT runs both the `qemu` and the `esp32c6` cartridge: use **Import
Cartridge** in the app, or the headless runner
`prg32qt-headless my-game-qemu.prg32 300 --dump-ppm frame.ppm`.
`tools/runtime_check.py` automates both for the example games
(`runtime_check.md`).

## Source-only bundles

If the toolchain is missing, the bundle is marked `source-only` and includes:

- `manifest.json`
- `icon.png`
- `source/game.c`
- `source/project.blocks.json`
- `source/game.ir.json`
- `BUILD_TOOLCHAIN_REQUIRED.txt`

This is useful for teaching conversion even on laptops that cannot build cartridges.

## Publishable bundles

If one or more `.prg32` files are produced, the manifest includes architecture entries and the bundle is marked publishable.
