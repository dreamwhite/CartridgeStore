# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Project context

PRG32 Cartridge Store is the classroom service for PRG32 cartridges. The
repository contains one Fastify/TypeScript API and one Next.js frontend behind
an Nginx edge. In the author's local environment, dnsmasq resolves the
development-only hosts `store.prg32.dream.test` and `api.prg32.dream.test`.
The backend reuses Dream Platform's external `dream_mail` network for Mailpit,
but this repository does not create a Mailpit service. These names are not
production domains; production must provide its own registered DNS names, TLS
certificates, public origins, cookie domain, and WebSocket URL through the
operational Compose variables.

Keep the educational character of the project: prefer readable, explicit code,
keep API contracts easy to explain in class, and keep setup instructions
reproducible.

## API compatibility

Do not break existing firmware/tool clients:

- `GET /api/games`
- `GET /api/games/<id>`
- `GET /api/games/<id>/icon`
- `GET /api/games/<id>/screenshot`
- `GET /api/games/<id>/colophon`
- `GET /api/games/<id>/download`
- `POST /api/publish`
- `GET/POST /api/scores`
- `POST /api/runs`
- `POST /api/metrics/batch`
- `POST /api/runs/<run_id>/finish`
- `GET /api/runs`
- `GET /api/runs/<run_id>`
- `GET /api/runs/<run_id>/samples.csv`
- `GET /api/runs/<run_id>/report.md`
- `GET /api/multiplayer/status`
- `WS /api/multiplayer`
- `GET /.well-known/prg32-store.json`

When changing response shapes, preserve old fields and add new optional fields
instead of replacing existing ones.

## Storage rules

- `PRG32_STORE_DATA` controls filesystem cartridge storage and the default
  SQLite database location.
- `PRG32_STORE_DB` controls the unified SQLite database path.
- Preserve support for `PRG32_SCORE_DB` and `PRG32_METRICS_DB` as compatibility
  fallbacks.
- Do not store uploaded cartridge data in SQLite; keep cartridge files in the
  filesystem store.
- Keep SQLite schema migrations idempotent with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
  and `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` unless a deliberate migration plan exists.

## Docker rules

- Keep the API listening on port `5080` in deployment images.
- Keep persistent data mounted at `/data` in deployment templates.
- Keep the WebSocket relay on the same HTTP port as the API.
- Images must run without host-specific paths.
- Local development uses `backend`, `next` and the repository-owned Nginx edge.
- Local development may attach the backend to the external `dream_mail`
  network; do not add a second Mailpit service to this Compose project.

## Firmware consistency

The companion repository is https://github.com/riscv-prg32/PRG32. Keep these
constants aligned in both repositories:

| Constant | Value |
|---|---|
| mDNS service type | `_prg32store._tcp` |
| mDNS default port | `5080` |
| Discovery ABI | `prg32-store-discovery-1.0` |
| Metadata ABI | `prg32-metadata-1.0` |
| Colophon ABI | `prg32-colophon-1.0` |
| Physical architecture | `esp32c6` |
| QEMU architecture | `qemu` |

Before changing a canonical constant, verify it in the companion repository.
Do not remove or rename fields from `/.well-known/prg32-store.json`.

## Validation

Use Node 24 and run the relevant checks before reporting completion:

```bash
source "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"
nvm use 24
pnpm --dir frontend run typecheck
pnpm --dir frontend run lint
pnpm --dir frontend run test
pnpm --dir frontend run build
pnpm --dir backend run typecheck
pnpm --dir backend run lint
pnpm --dir backend run test
pnpm --dir backend run build
docker compose config
pytest -q
git diff --check
```

Do not reset, clean destructively, checkout existing files, modify operational
data, or push commits unless the user explicitly requests it.
